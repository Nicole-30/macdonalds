            <h5>Early life and education</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Enonchong was born in the Southwest Region of Cameroon in 1967.[3] Her father was Dr. Henry Ndifor Abi
                Enonchong, who was a well-known barrister in Cameroon. While Enonchong was growing up in Cameroon, her
                father helped create the Federal Cameroon Bar Association and its successor, the Cameroon Bar
                Association.[4] <br> <br>

                In her teens, Enonchong moved to the US with her family.[5] While studying, she took up a job selling
                door-to-door newspaper subscriptions from the age of 15. She later became a manager at the same company
                at
                the age of 17.[6] <br><br>

                Enonchong attended the Catholic University of America, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science
                degree
                and also a Master of Science degree in Economics.[7]
            </p>
            <h5>Career</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                After finishing her education, Enonchong went on to work for a number of organizations including
                Inter-American Development Bank (IaDB) and Oracle Corporation.[8]

                In 1999, Enonchong founded the company AppsTech, a Bethesda, Maryland-based global provider of
                enterprise
                applications.[9] AppsTech is an Oracle Platinum Partner and has customers in over 40 countries.[9]
                <br><br>

                AppsTech opened offices in several countries, including Enonchong's native Cameroon.[10] She describes
                the
                experience as having been difficult and having led to the closure of AppsTech subsidiaries.[11][12]
                <br><br>

                In 2002, The World Economic Forum of Davos, Switzerland named Enonchong a Global Leader for Tomorrow
                (GLT)
                along with other tech entrepreneurs such as Google co-founder Larry Page and Salesforce.com CEO Marc
                Benioff.[13] <br><br>

                In 2013, Enonchong was recognized as a finalist for the African digital woman award.[14] In March 2014,
                Forbes listed her as one of the ‘10 Female Tech Founders to Watch in Africa’.[9][15]

                Enonchong has also gained notoriety as one of the more followed sources for African tech news on
                Twitter, <br><br>
                with over 30 thousand followers. Her handle, @Africatechie, has become a nickname for Enonchong in IT
                circles.[16]

                In August 2021, Rebecca Enonchong was arrested and taken into custody in Douala. Her lawyers denounce a
                "serious abuse of authority" on the part of the judicial system.[17]
